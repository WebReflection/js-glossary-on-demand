### before suggesting changes ...

Please consider reading twice the "_what this book is not_" chapter before suggesting any change.

If some concept is overly simplified, that's probably how it was supposed to be.

Moreover, if fixing any description requires the introduction of new words that are not instantly explained in the following chapter, such change won't, and shouldn't, make it.

To provide an example, if the definition of constants and `const` is the following:

> `const` declarations are for constant bindings but they don't guarantee immutable data objects

all we have is a "_special little circle of hell_" for people that do not know anything about programming.

The words `bindings`, `immutable` or even `objects` are presented as if the user knows what we are taling about but that's the whole point of this book: most users don't!

Under this vision, I welcome you to suggest any improvement you consider appropriate to any wording or code example.

**Thank You**,
  Andrea Giammarchi
